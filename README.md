 python-challenge week 3 Data Analytics bootcamp UoT

 I added different files for Week 3:
    - The README.md file with the details of the challenge and callouts of documentation research.
    - the "main.py" file with the code requested for the "PyBank" exercise in the PyBank folder.
    - the "budgetresults.txt" file, which is part of the requested solution of the code for the "PyBank" exercise. This is saved in the folder "analysis", within the "PyBank" folder.
    - the "main.py" file with the code requested for the "PyPoll" exercise in the PyPoll folder.
    - the "electionsresults.txt" file, which is part of the requested solution of the code for the "PyPoll" exercise. This is saved in the folder "analysis", within the "PyPoll" folder.

Some elements I had to research to apply in my codes are:
    - Single strings, which was used in both codes.  The source of the information is here: https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/python-f-strings-tutorial-how-to-use-f-strings-for-string-formatting/#:~:text=If%20you%20have%20multiple%20variables,%7D%20and%20%7Bvar_name%7D.%22
    - information on 'Sets' to acummulate unique values. The information was used in the "PyPoll" code.  The source of the information is: https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/python-set-method/
    - information on "counters", which was also applied to the "PyPoll" exercise.  The source of the information is: https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/python-counter-python-collections-counter
